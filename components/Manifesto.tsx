                We're two best friends living in downtown Toronto with a cat, preparing to welcome a dog into our lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may have met us through Tails of Toronto, where we filmed quiet, cinematic moments of you and your dog, so we could romanticise that feeling for ourselves.
              </p>

                <span className="block">It taught us to be grateful.</span>
                <span className="block">How life isn't a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced.</span>
                <span className="block">How our dogs hold us down on our darkest days.</span>
                <span className="block">The perfect project for two aggressively unemployed guys at the time.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                And the response was overwhelming.

              <p className="space-y-1">
                <span className="block">Somewhere along the way, we got attached.</span>
                <span className="block pl-4">To you.</span>
                <span className="block pl-4">To your dogs.</span>
                <span className="block pl-4">To what they mean to people like us in this city.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                This journal is the next step in that story.
              </p>
              <p>
                A place for us to explore what it truly means to bring a dog into our world, and what they bring into yours.
